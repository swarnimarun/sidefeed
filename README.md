# sidefeed

Simple aggregation service that takes links, as URLs and converts said URLs into a combined feed.
This allows for unified feeds and works agnostic to frontends.

## frontends for project

- example, [svelte-feeds](https://github.com/swarnimarun/svelte-feeds)
- example, [dioxus-feeds](https://github.com/swarnimarun/dioxus-feeds)

## Features

- Support for RSS(atom, v1 & v2) urls.
- Provide a HTTP REST API.
- Provide live-connection for feed updates(server-sent events).
- Support mass URL imports.

## Roadmap

- Support OPML imports.
- Support fediverse, and aggregation on hashtags.
- Support websockets for api.
- Add web-scraping for feed aggregation.
- Support profiles for building multiple feeds.
- Support auth(maybe?).

## Credits
